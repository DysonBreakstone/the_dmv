# The DMV

This is the starter repo for the BE Mod1 DMV project.

## Iteration 1 reflection
1. In order to dig into this code, I first looked at each of the classes and observed how each one interacted with the others. Then I ran the tests and while debugging, went through each class and took note of their attributes and methods.
2. It's a little disorienting to jump into someone else's code! I've gotten somewhat used to the idea since we've already been using pre-made rspec files, so even though we've been writing the classes I have had some experience looking at variables and determining whether they are a class, method, instance variable, etc. But still, putting together all the threads of an existing directory was a little bit of a challenge. 
3. I guess I more or less already talked about what made it a bit easier. Having a solid understanding of the data types involved certainly makes it a bit easier.
